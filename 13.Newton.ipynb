    "# Design - In the seventeenth century, Sir Isaac Newton discovered an algorithm for approximating the square root of a positive number. Recall that the square root y of a positive number x is the number y such that 2 5 y x. Newton discovered that if one’s initial estimate of y is z, then a better estimate of y can be obtained by taking the average of z together with x / z. The estimate can be transformed by this rule again and again, until a satisfactory estimate is reached.\n",

We then use Newton’s method to reset z to a better estimate and examine z to check it for closeness to the actual square root, 5. Here is a transcript of our interaction:\n",

Exactly how many of these operations are required depends on how close we want our final approximation to be to the actual square root. This closeness value, called the tolerance, can be compared to the difference between and the value of x and the square of our estimate at any given time.
